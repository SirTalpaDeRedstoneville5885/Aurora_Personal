			<h4>FAY TRAITS</h4>
			<p>Your fay character has an assortment of inborn abilities, part and parcel of dwarven nature.</p>			
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Constitution score increases by 2.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Fays mature at the same rate as elves, they‚Äôre considered young until they reach the age of 100. On average, they live about 2000 years.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Fays stand at less then 6 feet tall and average about 100 pounds. Your size is Medium.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Elven Body.</em></strong> You can breath both water and air, and can hold your breath for 8 times your constitution modifier (minimum 1). Also as a part Elf, you don't need to sleep. Instead, you meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Fairy Wings.</em></strong> Because of your wings, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed. You can‚Äôt use this flying speed if you‚Äôre wearing medium or heavy armor</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Common and elvish.</p>
