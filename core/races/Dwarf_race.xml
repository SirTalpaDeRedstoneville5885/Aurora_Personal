		<description>
			<p class="flavor">Kingdoms rich in ancient grandeur, halls carved into the roots of mountains, the echoing of picks and hammers in deep mines and blazing forges, a commitment to clan and tradition, and a burning hatred of goblins and orcs‚Äîthese common threads unite all dwarves.</p>
			<h4>SHORT AND STOUT</h4>
			<p>Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as skilled warriors, miners, and workers of stone and metal. Though they stand well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so broad and compact that they can weigh as much as a human standing nearly two feet taller. Their courage and endurance are also easily a match for any of the larger folk.</p>
			<p class="indent">Dwarven skin ranges from deep brown to a paler hue tinged with red, but the most common shades are light brown or deep tan, like certain tones of earth. Their hair, worn long but in simple styles, is usually black, gray, or brown, though paler dwarves often have red hair. Male dwarves value their beards highly and groom them carefully.</p>
			<h4>LONG MEMORY, LONG GRUDGES</h4>
			<p>Dwarves can live to be more than 400 years old, so the oldest living dwarves often remember a very different world. For example, some of the oldest dwarves living in Citadel Felbarr (in the world of the Forgotten Realms) can recall the day, more than three centuries ago, when orcs conquered the fortress and drove them into an exile that lasted over 250 years. This longevity grants them a perspective on the world that shorter-lived races such as humans and halflings lack.</p>
			<p class="indent">Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains they love, weathering the passage of centuries with stoic endurance and little change. They respect the traditions of their clans, tracing their ancestry back to the founding of their most ancient strongholds in the youth of the world, and don't abandon those traditions lightly. Part of those traditions is devotion to the gods of the dwarves, who uphold the dwarven ideals of industrious labor, skill in battle, and devotion to the forge.</p>
			<p class="indent">Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to their word and decisive in action, sometimes to the point of stubbornness. Many dwarves have a strong sense of justice, and they are slow to forget wrongs they have suffered. A wrong done to one dwarf is a wrong done to the dwarf‚Äôs entire clan, so what begins as one dwarf‚Äôs hunt for vengeance can become a full-blown clan feud.</p>

			</ul>
			<h4>DWARF TRAITS</h4>
			<p>Your dwarf character has an assortment of inborn abilities, part and parcel of dwarven nature.</p>			
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Constitution score increases by 2.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, but they‚Äôre considered young until they reach the age of 75. On average, they live about 315 years.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Dwarves stand between 4 and 5"6 feet tall and average about 150 pounds. Your size is Medium.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Natural Armor. </i></b> Due to your hard skin and the shape of your body, you are ill-suited to wearing armor. Your skin provides ample protection, however; it gives you a base AC of 17 (your Dexterity modifier doesn't affect this number). You gain no benefit from wearing armor, but if you are using a shield, you can apply the shield's bonus as normal.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Darkvision.</em></strong> Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can‚Äôt discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Tool Proficiency.</em></strong> You gain proficiency with the artisan‚Äôs tools of your choice: smith‚Äôs tools, jeweler's tools, or mason‚Äôs tools.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Common and Dwarvish. Dwarvish is full of hard consonants and guttural sounds, and those characteristics spill over into whatever other language a dwarf might speak.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Subrace.</em></strong> There exist a rare mutation in dwarves, that makes them Arcane Dwarves.</p>
